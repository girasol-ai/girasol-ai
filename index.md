          We are a group of PhD students. We believe that ideas are cheap. <b>Solid, reproducible</b> test-driven implementations are valuable and can increase the pace and quality of research. We aim to make researchers more accountable by curating a set of papers that can be verified in one go. We hope to form a community, where researchers are open to discussing the strengths and weaknesses of their work. Essentially, building a crowd-sourced QA community for research, where people can contribute by validating existing experiments, or creating value by adding new experiments.
